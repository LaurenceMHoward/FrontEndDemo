## Intent

This application runs in angular, and uses material design for functional libraries and css design. CSS is coded with LESS.
It was intended to run with the WebApiDemo repository, when that repository is run with http (as is settings). The main page loads a list of categories, which can be edited, deleted, or added to.
It therefore aligns with basic CRUD operations.
